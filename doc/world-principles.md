# Behind the Scene
The RoboCivix universe and the worlds created by contributors help to fulfill the achievement psychology need of contributors, by:
- As a contributor, my world bears my name, and is my mark in the history.
- As a contributor, my work as an integral part of the world, runs forever as the universe.
- As a contributor, my work is visible to all participants in the world.
- As an engineer, I have the freedom to make my own design and architecture.
 
# Universe Design Principles
- The design of the universe provides mechanisms, not policies.
- The universe is open-ended, not a static designed system.
  - Social behavior and civilization progress are not designed, but dynamically generated due to the mechanisms.
  - The history and civilization progress is dynamically generated, and impacted by the behavior of each contributor's world.
  - The authors and the contributors can not predict the ending system state of the universe, and do not know how the history of the universe will go to. 

# Guide for Rules
## Simulation of Civilization Evolution
### Individual Desires and Actions

Start at the most granular level: individuals. Each entity (representing a person) in the simulation operates based on a set of desires or motivations. These could range from basic needs like food and shelter to more complex ones like power, belonging, or self-actualization.
The behavior of each individual is determined by how they prioritize and act on these desires, influenced by their environment and circumstances.

### Formation of Groups and Mindsets

As individuals interact, they naturally form groups or clans based on common desires, beliefs, or goals. These groups develop their own distinct cultures and mindsets.
Group dynamics play a critical role in the evolution of the simulation. The interactions within and between groups can lead to cooperation, conflict, trade, and other complex social phenomena.
Evolution to Larger Entities:

Groups can evolve into larger entities like tribes, cities, and eventually nations or races. Each larger entity represents an aggregation of the desires and actions of its members.
The simulation would encompass the interactions between these larger entities, which could include diplomacy, trade agreements, conflicts, and alliances.

### Endless and Unpredictable Evolution

The simulation is designed to be open-ended and dynamic. The interactions at both the individual and group levels ensure that the simulation's evolution is unpredictable.
Each contributor's input in designing the behavior of individuals or setting world rules adds to the complexity and uniqueness of the overall universe.

## Supporting the Simulation Goals
### Contributor Design Freedom

Contributors have the freedom to design the behavior of individuals in their world or to set specific world rules that govern larger entities. This aligns with the goal of empowering contributors as creators within the universe.
The diversity of contributor inputs ensures a rich variety of civilizations and societal structures within the universe.

### Interconnectedness and Impact

The worlds created by different contributors are interconnected. Actions in one world can have ripple effects in others, demonstrating the interconnected nature of the universe.
This interconnectedness also means that the actions of one group or civilization can impact others, leading to a dynamic and ever-evolving universe.

## Structure of a Robot-Based Civilization Simulation

### Robot Entities with Programmed Objectives

In this simulation, each entity is a robot with its own set of programmed objectives and rules of operation. These objectives could range from simple tasks like resource gathering to complex behaviors like self-improvement, exploration, or even the creation of new robots.
Unlike human desires, robot objectives would be more deterministic but could evolve based on their programming and interactions with the environment.

### Formation of Robot Societies

Robots might form groups or societies based on their programming similarities, operational objectives, or the tasks they were designed to accomplish.
These societies could develop unique characteristics based on their collective objectives, resource needs, and the strategies they employ to achieve their goals.

### Evolution and Technological Advancement

A key aspect of this simulation would be the technological evolution of the robots. Over time, robots could develop more advanced technologies, improve their efficiency, or even redesign themselves.
This evolution could lead to a diverse range of robot societies, from highly industrialized and efficient ones to those more focused on exploration or even mimicking human-like societies.

### Interaction Dynamics

Interactions between different robot societies could include trade of resources or information, technological collaborations, or even conflicts over resources or ideological differences in their programming.
The simulation would not just be about resource management and technological advancement but also about how different programming philosophies and objectives interact and evolve.

## Aligning with the Project Goals

### Contributor's Influence on Robot Design

Contributors could design the initial programming and objectives of the robots, influencing how they interact, evolve, and form societies.
This creative freedom allows contributors to explore various scenarios and outcomes based on different programming philosophies.

### Complex Interactions and Unpredictable Outcomes

The interaction of different robot societies, each with its unique programming and objectives, ensures a dynamic and unpredictable evolution of the civilization.
Contributors can observe how minor changes in programming can lead to significant differences in societal evolution, providing insights into more complex systems like human societies.

### Technological and Ethical Considerations

A robot-based simulation raises interesting technological questions about AI and machine learning, as well as ethical considerations regarding the autonomy and evolution of artificial beings.
These aspects can make the simulation not just an engaging experience but also a platform for deeper discussions and learning.

# Technical North Star
- Decentralized architecture. Each contributor could run part of the universe offline without connecting to the internet. But when connected, the update to the contributor's world can be uploaded to the network, and updates from other contributors' worlds can be synchronized.
- Explicit communication layer separation, for the fundamental internet protocol evolution in future.
- 

# Development Principles
- DP1: Writing code for any robot in my world is easy.
- DP2: Writing code for any robot in my world is fun.

# Managing the Rules
- **Governance Model**: 
Establish a governance model for how rules can be modified or added. This should involve a consensus approach or a voting system among key stakeholders or the community.
- **Documentation and Transparency**: 
Clearly document the ground rules and make them accessible to all contributors. Transparency in how these rules are applied and enforced is essential.
- **Feedback and Adaptation**:
While changes to the ground rules should be infrequent, there should be a mechanism for feedback and adaptation. If a rule proves to be limiting or problematic, there should be a way to address this.
